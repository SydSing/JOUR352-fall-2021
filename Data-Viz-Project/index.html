  <h1>Eliminating Food Deserts in Baltimore City</h1>
  <h4>The elimination of food deserts in urban neighborhoods could better the health of city residents along with reducing food insecurity in households</h4>

  <h5>The major causes and effects of food deserts in Baltimore City on residents will be discussed, such as what makes a neighborhood a food desert, how poor health diets can affect the growth and development of children, food insecurity in households, food swamps, and the major health risks on all residents such as 

   <ul>
  <li>Obesity</li>
  <li>High Blood Pressure</li>
  <li>Cardiovascular Disease</li>
</ul>
       <p>In 2010 Baltimore City health officials discovered food deserts cover up to 30 percent of Baltimore, according to the Capital News Service. Within this research of food deserts, the Capital News Service article, Baltimore ‘Food Deserts’ Contribute to Health Problems, is the oldest scholarly source I’ve found. It can be inferred that 2010 was the height of the long-running issue the city knows today.</p>

       <p>In other words, food deserts are geographic areas with limited access to food, especially fresh fruits and vegetables. Specifically, to be considered to live in a food desert, according to the Urban Mobility and Equity Center, for walking, the threshold is 15 minutes (quarter-mile) and for driving it is 10 miles from a resident’s home to the nearest grocery store, food pantry, or food bank. Another neglected dynamic that creates a food desert is the lack of transportation, such as not owning a vehicle.</p>  

       <p>For urban areas such as the city of Baltimore, food deserts are commonly located in neighborhoods with higher poverty rates and predominantly Hispanic or African American neighborhoods, according to the article, Understanding Access to Grocery Stores in Food Deserts in Baltimore City. </p>
Although food deserts are widely known to exist in urban environments, rural households show higher rates of food insecurity due to the population density being very low, as a result, there are very few food retailers along with transportation challenges.

In many cases, food-insecure adults have to prioritize household bills, utilities, transportation, and medication over purchasing food, especially residents with health issues such as diabetes. As a result, they are most likely to consume less expensive and less healthful diets. While on the other hand when supermarkets in Baltimore permanently shut down, they are forced to pay more money to travel to the nearest supermarkets. Whether the money is going toward gas, public transportation, or rideshare, eventually there would be less money for medication or other bills, in many cases for those with health issues.

   <p>If you happen to do a simple Google search on the main factors that create food deserts you would frequently see it is because there is an increasing amount of residents who do not own vehicles and lack other transportation options. Although this is true, Baltimore has experienced a unique factor as to why food deserts have been an issue for over 10 years. Grocery stores such as Save A Lot, Target, and many other small business stores frequently permanently shut down in areas that need fresh produce.</p>

    <figcaption><h6><p class="font-italic">Baltimore City experiences another supermarket shutdown located on East Monument Street in McElderry Park</h6></p></figcaption>
</figure>


   <p> In October 2020, the food desert in Oliver East Baltimore grew due to the closing of Save A Lot. In this community, there is a senior citizen apartment building where residents relied on this grocery store where they either walked or rode their electric wheelchairs to purchase meat, fruits, and vegetables. According to the Baltimore Brew article, With Save A Lot closing in Oliver, East Baltimore’s food desert grows, residents weren’t told the reason for the permanent closing, their only replacement is the Chinese takeout spot, and the Hip Hop Fish & Chicken within that same shopping center, corner stores that engage in price gouging or the Harbor East Whole Foods which is 18 blocks away.</p>

    <p>Former Baltimore City Council candidate, Muller Paz, describes this situation more as a “food apartheid”, stating “I think ‘Food Desert’ makes it seem like an accident,” according to The Baltimore Brew. The online journal also quoted several residents living in the areas including, Monzella Howard Sr. who stated “It’ll be a big burden on the elderly,”</p>

    <p>Similarly in February 2018, with almost no warning or explanation, the Target located in Mondawmin Mall in West Baltimore shut down. A location where many of the nearby residents relied on picking up their medication along with purchasing groceries and quality goods. Although there is an additional grocery store within the shopping center, the pattern of grocery stores shutting down and left abandoned heavily affects the community. “To open a store like Target in an African American neighborhood gave this area legitimacy,” said the Rev. Frank Lance, pastor of Mount Lebanon Baptist Church in Mondawmin. “When the store closed, it was like saying, ‘You are not worthy after all’” according to the New York Times (NYT) article, Target Store Closings Show Limits of Pledge to Black Communities. </p>

</figure>

    <p>Although Target claims the store was not financially successful enough along with a history of underperformance to remain open, many former employees and nearby shoppers mentioned that the location always seemed to be crowded, was a well ran business, and met its’ profits in previous years. 
    Many community leaders such as Rev. Frank Lance were told that the location was closing due to high rates of theft, also known as “shrinkage”. According to the NYT article, the rioting and looting during 2015 due to the police killing of Freddie Gray, may have also spooked the company into shutting down. </p>

   <p> Otherwise, residents mentioned that this target location was providing a community service for employees and consumers. Whether the true reason for the permanent shutdown was underperformance, high rates of theft, or due to the negative reputation the city has, Nick J. Mosby, president of the Baltimore City Council, said “To just up and leave the neighborhood like that was unacceptable”, according to New York Times.</p>

 <p>In the image above is a map I’ve created of West Baltimore and the closest food stores in the area. Although this may look like there are frequent food stores, residents without vehicles have to travel about a mile to reach the nearest option. The marker labeled “Home” located on Riggs Avenue, just off of Whitmore Avenue, is the exact food desert I grew up in. Other than the Shoppers supermarket, the other markers did offer a few basic grocery items such as milk, bread, and non-perishables but a majority of these grocery and market stores were small corner stores that sold mainly sold junk food. </p>
  <p>The nearest supermarket where my grandmother and I were able to purchase all our basic needs for food was a 30 min walk. The next nearest supermarket is a Shop Rite which is a 1 hour and 14 min walk as the fastest route. Where I used to live is also considered a food swamp as there are several convenience stores on every corner of the community but do not create food-secure households.</p>
   <p>A counterargument is that food deserts do not exist and the proximity to supermarkets is the same as higher-income neighborhoods regardless of whether people own vehicles or not. But in this case, the opposite occurs where rather than supermarkets continuing to shut down in higher-income areas like Locust Point where they to continue to build supermarkets such as 
    <ul>
  <li>Whole Foods</li>
  <li>Harris Teeter</li>
  <li>Trader Joes</li>
</ul>
   Those also living in higher-income areas tend to own vehicles which makes it much easier to create a food-secure living environment daily. One of the many negative effects of food deserts is food swamps and the mass consumption of fast-food chains.</p>

    <h5><p>Due to the lack of supermarkets and grocery stores nearby, residents turn to corner stores and fast-food restaurants as a quick and easy solution. Although these corner stores sell a few grocery goods such as milk, canned foods, and toilet paper, food swamps have been associated with unhealthy dietary behaviors due to these stores also selling products high in sugar but lacking fresh fruits and vegetables. </p>

      <p>As a result of the lack of healthier food options, residents are at higher health risks of not only obesity but also high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. According to the article, Understanding Access to Grocery Stores in Food Deserts in Baltimore City, “A study on diabetes found that when determining glycemic control, based on HbA1c in patients with diabetes, individual factors related to food security were more significant than living in an area with low physical access to food.” Food swamps in Baltimore were found to be the leading cause of obesity within adolescents according to the article, Food swamps and food deserts in Baltimore City, MD, USA: associations with dietary behaviours among urban adolescent girls, African American adolescent girls (6th-7th grade) have a higher prevalence of obesity compared to Caucasian girls living in higher-income communities mainly due to chain supermarket availability in African American neighborhoods is about half that of white neighborhoods, according to the article mentioned.</p>

   <p>National studies have shown that food insecurity affects more than children’s physical health. According to the Community and International Nutrition, lack of a proper diet can affect children’s academic performance and social skills. Specifically, researchers found that children from ages 6-12 years old with poor diets have poorer mathematical scores, anxiety, and trouble getting along with other students. But as children become older, poor diets result in more severe effects such as depressive disorder, and suicide symptoms within 15-16-year-old adolescents.Researchers say children and adolescents receive these symptoms because those with low socioeconomic status have a higher level of cortisol, which is a hormone in humans that helps the body respond to stress, according to the article, Food Insecurity Affects School Children’s Academic Performance, Weight Gain, and Social Skills. Within this study, it is mentioned that food insecurity acts as a psychological or emotional stressor for not only children but also parents.</p>

   <p><iframe title="Item frequency found in different grocery stores" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-Bp64D" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Bp64D/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="289"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script></p>

<p> In the diagram above is a chart I’ve created based on the frequency of fresh produce, frozen food, fresh meat, non-perishables, dairy, and grains in various types of grocery stores. According to the article, Understanding Access to Grocery Stores in Baltimore City, supermarkets offer over 60% of every food category listed as compared to convenience stores (also known as corner stores) that maintain a 1.8% in fresh produce and a 0.7% in fresh meat. Food swamps continue to fill urban areas but lack provides goods to eliminate food insecurity. Supermarkets are the most beneficial to purchase groceries compared to whole stores, discount grocery, convenience stores specialty grocery, and non-profit co-ops. </p>
     <p> Not only do I have a personal experience of living in a food desert but I also lived in a food swamp where my grandmother and I walked across the street to the corner store almost every day to purchase chips, soda, and more. Being that the corner store was within walking distance it became a habit to walk there to purchase anything we were craving. This daily habit could cause an increase in weight gain among other severe health risks that would cause residents to be put on medication. </p>
   <p> The issue of food deserts in Baltimore seems to play as a “domino effect” or a chain of events. In other words, food deserts could be linked to several issues within the community. I believe eliminating this issue could help prevent many other bigger issues the city has experienced for generations. For example, the lack of supermarkets in certain areas creates a demand for food stores.Being that corner stores are much easier to build and open, small business owners are located in food deserts but instead of mainly selling produce and non-perishables, they sell snacks, desserts, and beverages high in sugar with little to no nutrition.</p>
   <p> Children and adolescents not receiving a balanced diet could result in a lack of self-control along with early delinquency, according to The Journal of Criminal Justice chapter, Considering the role of food insecurity in low self-control and early delinquency. Deviant behavior among food insecure victims contributes to the increasingly high crime and murder rate Baltimore City has experienced for generations. </p>
  
<a id="Possible_Solutions">
<p>Possible Solutions
    One of the many solutions I’ve created to help eliminate food deserts is for community leaders such as Baltimore City’s Health Department officials, and SNAP officials to host mobile grocery stores within various recreational spaces such as churches, parks, and community centers. Due to pastors and reverends being able to reach a variety of different residents of the community, it would be a more personable method to host many of these mobile grocery shops in churches. The mobile stores can be hosted 6 days out of the week during times many people get off work, while supermarket chains could supply the groceries.As for the residents who can not afford groceries, local churches could also host food banks and charities to help eliminate food insecurity in households regardless of their circumstances.</p>
   <p>Although many households face food insecurity due to not having the means to purchase food, others just need the convenience to be able to walk for groceries. Supermarket chains such as Shoppers and Shop Rite could still make a profit if they provide the goods for these mobile shops. A simpler way to reduce food deserts is for council members and city authorities such as Mayor, Brandon Scott, and President of City Council, Nick J. Mosby to also order that these corner stores swap these processed products for healthier options that households could create balanced diets. Although it will take time for food insecurity and food deserts to be eliminated, I believe consistently daily utilizing these solutions could make a difference within residents of Baltimore City.</p>
